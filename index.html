<h2>Travel Tracker is an Artificial Intelligence planner that is designed to track the best travel <br>
methods for you to get where you want to go in the most cost efficient manner.</h2>

<h2>What would set travel tracker apart is that its ability to monitor travel prices across the sky, over the road, <br>
or along the rail! While geared more toward the European continent, this can still be used within the United States as well!</h2>

<h2>Nothing is more frustrating currently than wanting to take a trip to Europe but the cost of tickets to your location <br>
is way more than you have. But what if you could fly to another location for half the price and then take a train to your location?</h2>

<h2>This would maximize your exposure to locations visited while staying under your budget. Travel Tracker would monitor and provide cost <br>
updates along the way of your trip and depending on the time of day, could even offer up hotel or hostels to stay at.</h2>
